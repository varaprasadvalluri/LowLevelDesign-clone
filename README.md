---------------------------------S.O.L.I.D Principles --------------------------------------------

**Single responsibility principle** - A class should have only one reason to change.

**Open/Closed principle** - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

**Liskov Substitution Principle** - Child classes should never break the parent class type definitions.

**Interface Segregation Principle** - No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

**Dependency inversion principle** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.



--------------HTTP Code ------------

1xx – informational – the request was received, continuing process
2xx – successful – the request was received successfully and accepted
3xx – redirection – further action needs to be taken to complete the request
4xx – client error – request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
5xx – server error – the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
 ----- Status codes meaning --------
200- ok
201- created
301 - found
400 -bad request
401 - unauthorized
403 -forbidden
404 - not found
405 - method not allowed 
408 - request timedout
413 - request entity too large 
429 - too many requests
